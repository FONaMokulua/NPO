        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><strong>Our Story:</strong> The Smith Family founded Friends of Nā Mokulua with the core mission of preserving the Mokulua Islands for future generations. As residents of the area, we've always had a deep love for these islands—spending countless hours exploring their beauty and enjoying everything they have to offer. The Mokulua Islands are not just a special place to us; they hold significant cultural, ecological, and spiritual value. We wanted to create an opportunity for others to experience these same wonders while ensuring their protection.

            However, over time, we began to witness the growing impact of tourism. People visiting the islands, some unfamiliar with its fragile ecosystem, were unintentionally harming the environment. We also saw visitors getting hurt due to the challenging and rocky landings on the islands. It became clear that something needed to be done to ensure the safety of both the visitors and the environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Our mission is simple: Malama ʻAina—care for the land. We founded Friends of Nā Mokulua to help preserve and protect the Mokulua Islands' natural beauty and unique ecosystems for future generations. We aim to educate visitors about the dangers of the island, the rules for preserving its natural beauty, and to assist those unfamiliar with the area in staying safe while respecting the ecosystem. We offer services such as helping tourists safely dock their boats, guiding them through the island’s terrain, picking up trash, and ensuring that both people and the environment are protected.</p>
        <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Our vision is to maintain the beauty and safety of the Mokulua Islands while offering help to tourists and visitors. We want to continue preserving the islands' unique flora and fauna, creating a sustainable balance where both the environment and visitors can coexist in harmony. We believe in long-term preservation, ensuring that the islands remain a pristine and safe place for future generations to enjoy.

            We aim to raise awareness of the islands' ecological significance and inspire responsible stewardship of this special area. Through education and direct action, we can make sure the islands’ delicate balance is maintained for years to come. </p>
        <p><strong>Our Contribution:</strong> As a family deeply connected to the Mokulua Islands, we’ve been actively involved in the preservation of these islands. We've paddled out to the Mokulua Islands countless times, cleaning up trash when we're there, helping visitors safely land, supporting them in navigating the challenging terrain, and educating them on the rules of the land, kindly. It’s always been important to us to ensure that the islands remain a safe and beautiful destination for everyone.

            We’ve also worked to raise awareness about the importance of maintaining the islands' natural state and educating others on how they can help protect this precious environment. By offering hands-on support and providing information, we hope to inspire others to join us in preserving the Mokes for future generations to enjoy.</p>
