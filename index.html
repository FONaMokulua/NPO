        <h2>Welcome to Friends of Nā Mokulua</h2>
        <p>We are a wildlife and nature conservation organization dedicated to the preservation of the Mokulua Islands. Our mission is to protect the islands' unique ecosystem while ensuring safety and sustainability for those visiting the area.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><strong>Our Story:</strong> I founded Friends of Nā Mokulua with the help of my family. Living near the Mokulua Islands, I’ve seen firsthand the impact of heavy tourist traffic on the environment. The islands face challenges from littering and occasional rescues due to the difficult landing conditions. This nonprofit was created to help restore and preserve the Mokulua Islands.</p>
        <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Our goal is to educate visitors about the dangers of the island, the rules for preserving its natural beauty, and to help people unfamiliar with the island stay safe while respecting the ecosystem. We assist tourists with docking their boats, picking up trash, and ensuring that both people and the environment stay safe.</p>
        <p><strong>Vision:</strong> To maintain the beauty and safety of the Mokulua Islands, offering help to tourists while preserving the islands' unique flora and fauna for future generations.</p>
        <p><strong>My Contribution:</strong> I've personally paddled out to the islands countless times to assist in picking up trash and help visitors safely land. I’ve also worked to raise awareness about the importance of maintaining the island's natural state.</p>

        <h2>Our Services</h2>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>Assistance for Tourists</h3>
            <p>We help visitors safely cross the water, dock, and undock their boats while ensuring they respect the island’s wildlife and ecosystem. Navigating to the Mokulua Islands can be challenging, especially for first-time visitors, and our team is here to assist with water safety, as well as guidance on docking or undocking boats safely. This service is especially important as the island's rocky shores can make it difficult for boats to land, and we want to ensure both the tourists and the island remain safe.</p>

            <h3>Wildlife Protection</h3>
            <p>The Mokulua Islands are home to several endangered species, including native seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals. We take great care to educate visitors on how to respect and protect these animals. Our team enforces rules gently but firmly, reminding everyone that the island is a sanctuary for wildlife. We actively monitor the bird nesting areas and ensure that visitors stay at a safe distance from these sensitive habitats, preventing harm to the animals while maintaining the natural balance of the island.</p>

        <h2>About the Mokulua Islands</h2>
        <p>The Mokulua Islands, or "Mokes" as they are affectionately known, are two small islands located off the windward coast of Oahu, Hawaii. They are famous for their dramatic scenery, unique wildlife, and rich cultural history. The islands are home to native seabirds, such as the endangered Laysan albatross, as well as Hawaiian monk seals that use the beaches for hauling out and pupping. Access to the islands is regulated to prevent damage to the natural habitat, and visitors are expected to follow specific guidelines to protect the delicate ecosystem.</p>
        <p>These islands were once used by ancient Hawaiians for fishing and as a refuge, and their significance continues to this day. We at Friends of Nā Mokulua are dedicated to preserving their natural beauty, educating the public on their importance, and ensuring that future generations can enjoy them as much as we do.</p>
